A collection of Pandas maneuvers

This repository is a place to collect Pandas "maneuvers" that took me some research and/or playing around to figure out, and I want an easy way to find them again.

I don't know if anything here will be valuable to others, but it might as well be public, and if it helps someone that's great.  Plus, this way I (and others) can link to the notebooks, etc, from elsewhere.

When possible, for things I learned from others, I will give credit to the original source.  However, sometimes, by the time I get around to posting an item here, I may not be able to find the oringal source anymore.
